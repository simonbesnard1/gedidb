**gediDB** is an open source project and Python
package that makes working with GEDI L2A-B and L4A-C data easy and fun! It is designed to streamline the processing, analysis, and management of GEDI data. The toolbox provides an intuitive interface for handling large volumes of GEDI data, automating the downloading, parsing, and processing of GEDI granules. Built to work efficiently with GEDIâ€™s products, it is tailored for scientists, researchers, and data analysts working in fields like ecology, forestry, remote sensing, and environmental science.

**gediDB** integrates key functionalities such as structured data querying, multi-dimensional data processing, and metadata management. With built-in support for Dask, the toolbox ensures scalability for large datasets, allowing efficient parallel processing on local machines or clusters.

## Key Features of gediDB

- Granule Management: Automatically download and process GEDI granules across different product levels (i.e., L2A, L2B, L4A, L4C) in parallel, ensuring metadata consistency and data quality.
- Flexible Data Querying: Query data from the GEDI database using labeled dimensions such as time, location, and beam name. The SQL-based querying allows for precise data extraction, filtered by various spatial and temporal constraints.
- Parallel Processing with Dask: Seamlessly process large datasets in parallel using Dask, enabling concurrent downloading, processing, and database insertion of GEDI products. The number of concurrent processes can be easily controlled based on system resources.
- Metadata-Driven: Maintain and manage metadata for each dataset, ensuring that important contextual information such as units, descriptions, and source details are stored and accessible.
- Geospatial Data Management: Built-in support for geospatial data types using GeoPandas, allowing seamless spatial queries and operations.

## Why gediDB?
**gediDB** simplifies and automates the workflow of processing GEDI data, reducing manual work and enabling efficient parallel processing for large-scale datasets. Whether you're conducting ecological studies, analyzing biomass data, or investigating land surface dynamics, **gediDB** support users with the tools to quickly process and access GEDI data.

## History

The development of the gediDB package began during the PhD of Amelia Holcomb, who initially created the core of this toolset to analyze and manage GEDI data for her research. Recognizing the potential of her work to benefit the broader scientific community, the [Global Land Monitoring](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/section/remote-sensing-and-geoinformatics/topics/global-land-monitoring) team collaborated in March 2024 with Amelia to expand and optimize her code, transforming it into a scalable and versatile Python package named gediDB. This collaboration helped refine the toolbox to handle large-scale datasets, integrate parallel processing, and incorporate a robust querying and metadata management system. Today, gediDB is designed to help researchers in ecological and environmental sciences by making GEDI data processing more efficient and accessible.
