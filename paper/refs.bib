abstract = {Obtaining accurate and widespread measurements of the vertical structure of the Earth’s forests has been a long-sought goal for the ecological community. Such observations are critical for accurately assessing the existing biomass of forests, and how changes in this biomass caused by human activities or variations in climate may impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Additionally, the three-dimensional structure of forests is a key component of habitat quality and biodiversity at local to regional scales. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was launched to the International Space Station in late 2018 to provide high-quality measurements of forest vertical structure in temperate and tropical forests between 51.6° N & S latitude. The GEDI instrument is a geodetic-class laser altimeter/waveform lidar comprised of 3 lasers that produce 8 transects of structural information. Over its two-year nominal lifetime GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 ​m. These data will be used to derive a variety of footprint and gridded products, including canopy height, canopy foliar profiles, Leaf Area Index (LAI), sub-canopy topography and biomass. Additionally, data from GEDI are used to demonstrate the efficacy of its measurements for prognostic ecosystem modeling, habit and biodiversity studies, and for fusion using radar and other remote sensing instruments. GEDI science and technology are unique: no other space-based mission has been created that is specifically optimized for retrieving vegetation vertical structure. As such, GEDI promises to advance our understanding of the importance of canopy vertical variations within an ecological paradigm based on structure, composition and function.}

abstract = {More of the Amazon rainforest is disturbed each year than completely deforested, but the impact of these disturbances on the carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Recent algorithmic advances using optical and radar remote sensing have improved detection of disturbances at fine spatiotemporal resolution, but quantifying changes in forest structure and biomass associated with these detected disturbances has proven challenging. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a spaceborne lidar mission collecting data from 2019 to 2023, provides an opportunity to address this problem. GEDI captured billions of measurements of forest height, plant area, and understory structure within ∼25-m diameter footprints scattered across the tropics. Though the instrument had no guaranteed repeat cycle, it sometimes sampled nearby locations twice; some of these spatially near-coincident footprints happened to measure forest structure before and after a detected disturbance, providing information on how disturbance affected aboveground biomass. In this study, we developed an efficient general-purpose open-source pipeline for identifying spatially coincident footprints, which is a computationally complex task, and used the pipeline to find over 13,700 footprint pairs with intervening disturbance events across the Amazon biome. We also identified a set of ∼65,000 spatially near-coincident footprint pairs that lacked an intervening disturbance but came from regions with similar disturbance threat; these provided a control dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of estimating forest structure and biomass changes with nearby footprints. Analysis of this Amazon-wide dataset demonstrated that GEDI was able to measure statistically significant canopy height and biomass deficits following non-stand-replacing disturbances as small as 900 m2 (30 m × 30 m). GEDI's unique three-dimensional view of forest structure also reflected the effects of different intensities of fire disturbance, including 20% of burned areas where the upper canopy retained most of its height, but the understory suffered substantial foliage losses. Finally, we modeled the relationship between Landsat and Sentinel-1 disturbance detection parameters and GEDI-estimated percent biomass loss, showing that certain satellite-derived intensity metrics are correlated with increasing biomass loss and identifying temporal trends in biomass loss and recovery following disturbance. This work represents an important step towards the development of a pan-tropical, spatially explicit system for tracking carbon losses and structural changes arising from forest disturbance.}

	title = {Measuring tropical forest disturbance and regrowth with spaceborne lidar},
	url = {https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/389269},
	abstract = {The world’s tropical forests are vulnerable, facing threats of deforestation and anthropogenic disturbances, but they are also the site of enormous potential for forest growth. While these changes in tropical forest frontiers are widely agreed to have major implications for global carbon fluxes and biodiversity, it is difficult to quantify their impact using traditional optical and radar remote sensing. As a result, there is wide scientific uncertainty about the scale and trajectory of tropical forest loss and gain, and forest degradation is rarely incorporated into international conservation commitments or land use change reporting. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a spaceborne lidar sensor, offers the opportunity to measure forest structure and carbon stocks at global scale, and is sensitive enough to capture subtle forest variation even under dense tropical canopies. However, it is computationally challenging to use GEDI directly to measure change, because of the instrument’s sparse sampling pattern, geolocation uncertainty, and unwieldy data size – billions of measurements comprising hundreds of terabytes of raw data. Indeed, early publications raised explicit doubts that GEDI would be suitable for studying forest disturbance. In this PhD, I develop advanced computational techniques to overcome the limitations of GEDI and make use of these techniques to answer ecological questions about the impact of regrowth and disturbance in tropical forests. In doing so, I argue that GEDI can be used to monitor tropical forest changes – sometimes, in unexpected ways that exceed the limitations assumed by prior research. This finding has important implications for our scientific understanding of carbon fluxes and biodiversity impacts in disturbed tropical forests, for research priorities in distributed geospatial computing to support future spaceborne lidar missions, and for international policy goals.},
