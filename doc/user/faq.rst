How should I cite gediDB?
-------------------------

Please use the following citation when referencing gediDB in your work:

> Besnard, S., Dombrowski, F., & Holcomb, A. (2024). gediDB (2.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13885229

What are the main features of gediDB?
-------------------------------------

GediDB is a tileDB-based tool designed to manage, query, and analyze large-scale GEDI data. Its main features include:

- Efficient storage and querying of GEDI shot data with geospatial capabilities.
- Automated data loading and processing with support for GEDI L2A, L2B, L4A, and L4C products.
- Flexible filtering based on spatial, temporal, and quality parameters.

Which versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS are supported?
-------------------------------------------------------

GediDB is compatible with PostgreSQL version 12 or higher and requires the PostGIS extension for geospatial operations. We recommend using the latest stable versions of both PostgreSQL and PostGIS to ensure full compatibility and performance optimization.

How do I set up the database for GEDI?
----------------------------------------

To set up a GEDI database:
1. Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS.
2. Follow the instructions in the setup guide to create the necessary tables and enable PostGIS.
3. Download and apply the schema file (`db_scheme.sql`) provided with gediDB to configure the database structure.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the :ref:`database setup <database-setup>` section.

Can I use the database scheme with other data besides GEDI?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The database scheme is specifically optimized for GEDI data structure and geospatial requirements. While itâ€™s possible to adapt the database schema and functionality for other data, significant modifications would be required.

What data products does gediDB support?
---------------------------------------

GediDB supports the following GEDI data products:

- **Level 2A**: Contains geolocated waveform data and relative height metrics.
- **Level 2B**: Includes vegetation canopy cover and vertical profile metrics.
- **Level 4A**: Provides aboveground biomass density estimates.
- **Level 4C**: Includes gridded biomass estimates at global scales.

What permissions are needed to use GEDI database?
-------------------------------------------------

To load, query, and manage data in the GEDI database, you need access to the PostgreSQL database with appropriate permissions:

- **Admin user**: Full privileges, including schema modification and data insertion.
- **Read-only user**: Limited to querying data for analysis without modification rights.

Can I use the GEDI database on cloud-hosted databases?
------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the GEDI database can be deployed on cloud-hosted PostgreSQL instances with PostGIS support, such as Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Microsoft Azure. Ensure the cloud database service supports PostGIS and has adequate resources to handle large GEDI datasets.

How can I update the GEDI database to a newer version?
------------------------------------------------------

To update the GEDI database:

1. Backup your database to avoid data loss.
2. Apply any new schema changes by running the updated `db_scheme.sql`.
3. Review release notes for any changes that might require modifications to your database setup or data-loading workflows.

How do I write GEDI data into the database?
-------------------------------------------

You can load GEDI data into a GEDI database by using the :py:class:`gedidb.GEDIProcessor` class provided in the gediDB package. Configure the `data_config.yml` file with your data paths and database details, then run the processor to handle data download, processing, and insertion.

Where can I find more examples for using gediDB?
------------------------------------------------

Refer to the :ref:`tutorials` section in the documentation for example notebooks demonstrating how to use :py:class:`gedidb.GEDIProcessor` and  :py:class:`gedidb.GEDIProvider` classes for data processing and querying.
