Overview: Why gediDB?
=====================

**gediDB** is a powerful, scalable Python package designed to simplify and accelerate working with **GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation)** data. It offers an intuitive and high-level interface for querying, processing, and analyzing GEDI data stored in **PostgreSQL** databases, with seamless integration into modern data science workflows.

What gediDB Enables
-------------------

Handling GEDI data is challenging due to its high dimensionality and geospatial components. **gediDB** addresses these complexities by providing a user-friendly API, empowering users to efficiently manage and process GEDI data. gediDB leverages leading Python libraries, such as **GeoPandas**, **xarray**, and **Dask**, to simplify data workflows while enabling scalability.

With gediDB, you can:

- **Easily query GEDI data**: Filter by variable names, geographic regions, and time intervals.
- **Perform advanced geospatial queries**: Harness the power of **PostgreSQL** and **PostGIS** for spatially enabled data retrieval using SQL.
- **Distribute processing tasks**: Use **Dask** to parallelize and distribute processing, ensuring that large-scale GEDI datasets are handled efficiently.
- **Combine multiple GEDI products**: Seamlessly join GEDI products (like Level 2A, 2B, and 4A) into unified datasets for more comprehensive analyses.

By abstracting the complexities of working with raw GEDI HDF5 files, gediDB allows researchers and data analysts to focus on their scientific goals instead of data management.

The GEDI Data Model
-------------------

GEDI data is inherently multi-dimensional, involving various sensor measurements over time, space, and height. Processing and interpreting this raw data can be difficult and error-prone. **gediDB** abstracts this complexity, aligning data dimensions and offering intuitive APIs for accessing and manipulating the data. For example, users can:

- **Filter GEDI data over time and space**: Access data based on geospatial coordinates or temporal ranges.
- **Merge and unify GEDI products**: Combine multiple GEDI product levels into one dataset, making the analysis process smoother and more efficient.
- **Perform spatial operations**: Conduct geospatial queries based on custom-defined boundaries like forests, parks, or user-generated polygons.

Core Components of gediDB
-------------------------

gediDB is built around two key components:

1. **`GEDIDProcessor`**:

2. **`GEDIProvider`**: This high-level interface allows you to query GEDI data from a PostgreSQL database and retrieve it as **Pandas** DataFrames or **xarray** Datasets. You can specify variables, apply spatial filters, and define time ranges to extract the data you need.


These components make it easy for users to access and manipulate GEDI data in a structured and organized manner, without losing the relationships between various datasets and metadata.

Goals and Aspirations
---------------------

The primary goal of gediDB is to provide an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly platform for working with GEDI data, tailored to the needs of a wide array of fields:

- **Geosciences**: Researchers analyzing forest structure, canopy height, and biomass using GEDI data.
- **Remote Sensing**: Scientists combining GEDI data with other remote sensing products to study ecosystems, vegetation, and terrain.
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Developers integrating GEDI data into data pipelines for analysis, modeling, and prediction at scale.

By offering a strong foundation for querying and processing GEDI data, gediDB aspires to be the go-to solution for researchers working with ecosystem dynamics datasets.

A Collaborative Project
####################### 

**gediDB** began as a research tool during **Amelia Holcomb**â€™s PhD. Since then, it has evolved into a full-fledged, scalable Python package through collaboration with the **GLM team**. This transformation was driven by the need for a production-ready tool that could handle large datasets and complex queries in an efficient and scalable manner. The gediDB project remains open-source, and contributions from the research community are always welcome to help it grow and adapt to emerging needs.
