Setting up a Database
#####################

This section guides you through the process of setting up a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extensions, tailored specifically for working with GEDI data via the **gediDB** package. 

A solid understanding of database management is recommended before proceeding. If you are unfamiliar with PostGIS or PostgreSQL setup, the provided external resources will give you the necessary background to get started.

Overview
--------

The **gediDB** package integrates seamlessly with PostgreSQL/PostGIS databases, enabling you to store and query large-scale GEDI data efficiently. The database is the backbone of the GEDI data workflow, supporting geospatial queries, efficient storage of multi-dimensional datasets, and enabling data filtering based on both temporal and spatial parameters.

To get started, follow the steps outlined in the guide to:
- Set up a PostGIS-enabled PostgreSQL database.
- Configure the database schema for storing GEDI data.
- Connect **gediDB** to your database for data insertion and querying.

.. note::

   PostGIS provides geospatial capabilities to your PostgreSQL database, making it the perfect choice for handling GEDI's spatial data, such as forest structure, biomass, and canopy height.

Step-by-Step Instructions
-------------------------

Below are detailed steps to help you set up your own GEDI database.
