Terminology
===========

*Xarray terminology differs slightly from CF, mathematical conventions, and
pandas; so we've put together a glossary of its terms. Here,* ``arr``
*refers to an xarray* :py:class:`DataArray` *in the examples. For more
complete examples, please consult the relevant documentation.*

.. glossary::

    DataArray
        A multi-dimensional array with labeled or named
        dimensions. ``DataArray`` objects add metadata such as dimension names,
        coordinates, and attributes (defined below) to underlying "unlabeled"
        data structures such as numpy and Dask arrays. If its optional ``name``
        property is set, it is a *named DataArray*.

    Dataset
        A dict-like collection of ``DataArray`` objects with aligned
        dimensions. Thus, most operations that can be performed on the
        dimensions of a single ``DataArray`` can be performed on a
        dataset. Datasets have data variables (see **Variable** below),
        dimensions, coordinates, and attributes.

    Variable
        A `NetCDF-like variable
        <https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/netcdf_data_set_components.html#variables>`_
        consisting of dimensions, data, and attributes which describe a single
        array. The main functional difference between variables and numpy arrays
        is that numerical operations on variables implement array broadcasting
        by dimension name. Each ``DataArray`` has an underlying variable that
        can be accessed via ``arr.variable``. However, a variable is not fully
        described outside of either a ``Dataset`` or a ``DataArray``.

        .. note::

            The :py:class:`Variable` class is low-level interface and can
            typically be ignored. However, the word "variable" appears often
            enough in the code and documentation that is useful to understand.
